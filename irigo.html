        <h1>Irigo Ikinagi</h1>
        <p>Main Character in the series. Very calm and collective but kind short tempered, with some humor.
                Irigo was born amongst the devine tribe, as son to Rakira Ikinagi ( the heaven blessed angel of the clan), and Eniyo Karima (The dark realms cast out who found life amongst the devine clan and fell in love with Rakira). Irigo was saved and raised by his fake parents when his village was destroyed by the wrath of the the demon-lord "Kiri"(brother of Eniyo). Irigo grows up with the eyes only four special members of his clan had, but he gain more advanced powers down the line as he battles beside his friends. </p>
